              My name is Albert Rusch and I am a motivated Fullstack developer
              from Germany, who is always eager to learn new things. I have a
              friendly and warm personality that helps me connect with people
              from all walks of life. As a goal-oriented individual, I am
              constantly striving to achieve excellence in everything I do. I
              have a passion for solving problems and finding creative solutions
              to complex challenges. This has helped me become a skilled
              developer in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, I have
              experience working with React, a powerful front-end library that
              has become the standard for building modern web applications.
              While I am self-sufficient and able to work independently, I also
              value collaboration and teamwork. I believe that by working
              together, we can achieve great things and create better solutions
              than we could alone.

            <h3>Floh Store</h3>
            <p>
              Floh.Store began with the idea of creating a product that could compete with established services, built
              using the MERN stack and offering advanced features. Our development process involved capturing ideas in
              Figma, structuring them into TODO lists, and translating them into code. The backend is secured with JWT,
              CSRF protection, and cookies, while the frontend uses modern technologies like WebSocket for fast data
              transmission. The platform is optimized for mobile-first use and works well on ultrawide screens.
              Available as both a website and an Android app, Floh.Store is the result of intense collaboration and
              marks the beginning of our journey in software development.

            <h3>My Calculator</h3>
            <p>
              Created a functional calculator website using JavaScript. The
              calculator supports essential operations such as addition,
              subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it
              includes features for square root and percentage calculations.
              Robust error handling ensures the calculator responds
              appropriately to invalid inputs. The calculator utilizes
              object-oriented programming principles, featuring a Calculator
              class with methods for performing mathematical operations. It
              can handle various calculations, including addition,
              subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder,
              exponentiation, square root, and percentage calculations. The
              code also includes checks for dividing by zero and handling
              negative numbers when calculating square roots. In the
              interface, buttons trigger corresponding functions to append
              numbers and operators to the input, enabling users to perform
              calculations with ease. The calculator's result area dynamically
              updates as users input expressions, providing real-time
              feedback. The script also includes console log statements for
              testing various calculator methods, ensuring their accuracy and
              reliability. This project highlights my proficiency in
              JavaScript and my ability to create interactive web applications
              with error-free mathematical computations.

            <h3>Slot Game</h3>

            <p>
              This project is a simple slot game created to practice JavaScript. Players start with 100 coins and can
              play by pressing the spacebar. The game features six symbols and randomly selects three each turn. Winning
              combinations grant coin rewards, while losing deducts coins. The game includes a user interface that
              displays the current coin count and the results of each spin.

              The code consists of functions to manage coin addition and deduction, symbol selection, win calculation,
              and display updates. While not highly complex, this project serves as a foundational exercise in
              JavaScript programming and DOM manipulation, providing an interactive experience for users.

            <h3>Offer Section</h3>

            <p>
              One of my early attempts at web design involved creating a
              mobile service offers section that featured responsive cards.
              These cards were designed to react and move slightly when users
              hovered over them or selected them, similar to the design of
              well-known mobile service providers. Each card represented a
              different mobile service offer, and they were designed to be
              responsive to different screen sizes and devices. This was
              achieved using CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques.
              The cards themselves were designed using a combination of HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript. They featured eye-catching graphics, bold
              text, and clear calls to action. The hover and selection effects
              were achieved using animations and transitions. Overall, this
              project was a fun challenge that taught me a lot about
              responsive web design and how to create engaging and interactive
              user interfaces. It also helped me to refine my design skills
              and experiment with new techniques and technologies.

            <h3>Retro Game</h3>
            <p>
              I created a Retro Snake Game using the HTML5 Canvas element.
              This was one of my first projects, and I pieced together the
              necessary parts of the code to make it work. The game is a
              classic iteration of the popular Snake game from the 1970s. The
              objective is to guide the snake to eat the food on the screen,
              while avoiding collisions with the snake's own tail. The snake's
              movement is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The
              game increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer and the
              speed increases. The player can earn points by eating the food,
              and the game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its
              own tail. Overall, the game was a fun project to work on, and it
              allowed me to experiment with the Canvas element and game
              development in HTML5.

            <h3>Shuffle Button</h3>
            <p>
              My first website was a simple one-page site with a Shuffle
              Button feature that I implemented using JavaScript, even though
              I didn't know a single line of code in the language. The Shuffle
              Button was designed to randomly select a name from a list of
              names that were pre-defined in the code. This was helpful when I
              needed to randomly select a person for a task or an event.
              Although the code was simple, it was a big accomplishment for me
              at the time, as I had never worked with JavaScript before. This
              project sparked my interest in web development and inspired me
              to learn more about programming and the potential of the web.
              Looking back on this project, I am proud of what I was able to
              accomplish with limited knowledge and resources. It taught me
              the importance of experimenting and trying new things, and it
              inspired me to continue learning and growing as a developer.
